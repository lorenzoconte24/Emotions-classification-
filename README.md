# Emotions-classification-
Deep learning project developed with two other colleagues. We use Google Colab power (GPU) and the infrastructure provided by the library Pytorch.
The scope of this project was to create a network, using already known structures studied in class (LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet...) with some modifications, that correctly 
classify the images into the respective emotion class.
